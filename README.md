This is a proof of concept (POC) project to show a light-weight version of our competition booking platform. The aim is to keep things as light as possible and use feedback from the users to iterate.

## Getting Started

This project uses the following technologies:

- Python v3.x+
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

  Whereas Django does a lot of things for us out of the box, Flask allows us to add only what we need.

- [Virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation.html)

  This ensures you'll be able to install the correct packages without interfering with Python on your machine. Before you begin, please ensure you have this installed globally.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samichelly/PROJECT_11_gudlift_registration.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd PROJECT_11_gudlift_registration
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set the Flask application environment variable to `server.py`:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=server.py
   ```
   For Windows, use:
   ```bash
   set FLASK_APP=server.py
   ```
6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python -m flask run
   ```

## Current Setup

The app is powered by [JSON files](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_quick_guide.htm). This is to get around having a database until we actually need one. The main JSON files are:
- `competitions.json` - list of competitions
- `clubs.json` - list of clubs with relevant information. You can look here to see what email addresses the app will accept for login.

## Testing

You are free to use whatever testing framework you likeâ€”the main thing is that you can show what tests you are using. We also like to show how well we're testing, so there's a module called [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/) you should add to your project.
